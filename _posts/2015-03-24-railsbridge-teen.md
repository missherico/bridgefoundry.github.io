title: Railsbridge Teen Organizing Tips
draft: true
---

Last year Panama City, FL offered the first ever "Railsbridge Teen" and it turned out to be an amazing experience.  Most of the effort planning a teen Railsbridge paralleled the organizer cookbook preparation used for a traditional workshops, with just a few exceptions:

**Parent Permission and Involvement**
Several of the parents stayed and decided to go through the curriculum along with their teen and I highly recommend this if possible.  For those that chose not to stay we found it best to discuss the following before they leave:

* Does your teen have an email address they can access?
  * They will be registering for web-based accounts (github, heroku, etc)
  * Are there any restrictions on installing anything to this computer?

**Age Guidelines**

We established an original age guideline at 13-18 but we made a few exceptions allowing some as young as 9 to attend if they'd had programming experience.  *Sidenote: Yes the 9 year old completed the entire workshop and understood the concepts.

**Bypassing Installfest**
For most of the kids the schedule and transport issues meant committing to a Friday night and full day Saturday would be nearly impossible.  We modified the curriculum to plan on <em>not</em> having an Installfest. I'll be sharing the tools and modifications we used to work around the Installfest limitation.

**Food**
Food for Railsbridge Teen is so much easier than a traditional Railsbridge.  Rather than a catered lunch or coffee and breakfast the kids wanted donuts and snacks.  Lots of snacks.  They asked for $5 pizzas and bags of cheetos and all the world was right.  If you can, go ahead and include the attendees in the planning of their own workshop. Teens are very good at telling you what they want.

**Venue**
The process of choosing a venue was not the same as it is for us traditionally with adults.  It was essential to look into venues the kids were already comfortable, such as the library meeting room, clubhouses, community centers, etc.  In the end we chose a place several kids were already meeting for their school co-op activities. The facility had a kitchen, plenty of tables/chairs, and internet access.

**Curriculum Flexbility**
We did not change any of the core aspects of the curriculum.  The teens built Suggestotron just as the adults do and enjoyed it a lot.

* **Be prepared to deviate from the curriculum and bring them back.** - Typically in a workshop the curriculum is adhered to pretty closely.  For teens they have an uninhibited willingness to try things without worrying about consequence.  </li>
* **Have a smaller ratio of volunteers to students** -  I had to do much more troubleshooting than I typically would because they wanted to "see if this would do anything if I change it".  Rather than forcing them to conform I encouraged the experimentation but insisted they be part of resolving the error rather than fixing it for them.  Volunteers help a lot when this happens.

**Stickers and Rewards**
I can't say enough about how such a tiny thing creates HUGE motivation.  We had stickers from <a href="http://stickermule.com" title="Stickermule" target="_blank">Stickermule</a> that were a big hit and became the coveted accessory for every laptop in the room.

**Stay in Touch**
A larger percentage of teens in the workshop will be eager to continue and learn more than you may find in a traditional workshop.  Consider hosting a monthly meetup with the teens to continue to check on their progress.  We'll share more on follow up in the weeks to come.
